# DM-HW1
Homework 1 for Data Mining Spring 2025\

You can find my written responses in the "HW1_responses" word document. "HW1_responses" also has details on how the graphs correspond to each question and dataset. All of my graphs are in the "graphs" subfolder.\
<br/>

**Homework 1(a)**\
I created one python file for each of the six datasets (see below). Each file trains on the training dataset and 
tests on the testing dataset. For example, hw_1a_100_10.py trains the model on train-100-10.csv and tests the model
using test-100-10.csv. The corresponding graphs can be found in the "graphs" subfolder.\
<br/>
Python files for **Homework 1(a):** 
- hw1_1a_100_10.py
- hw1_1a_100-100.py
- hw1_1a_1000_100.py
- hw1_1a_50_1000_100.py
- hw1_1a_100_1000_100.py
- hw1_1a_150_1000_100.py
<br/>

**Homework 1(b)**\
Similarly to homework 1(a), I created one python file for each dataset. Each file trains on the dataset I created per the
instructions and tests on test-1000-100.csv. The corresponding graphs can be found in the "graphs" subfolder.\
<br/>
Python files for **Homework 1(b):**
- hw1_1b_50_1000_100.py
- hw1_1b_100_1000_100.py
- hw1_1b_150_1000_100.py
<br/>

**Homework 2(a)**\
I only have one python file for homework #2 that does the calculations for all of the files. This python file exports a csv
of the dataframe that contains all of the MSE values for the 10-fold CV for each dataset. Because this file runs for all six datasets, it slow in comparison to the other files. On my Microsoft Surface Pro 9, it took about 3.5 - 4 minutes to run.\

Python file for **Homework 2(a):**\
-hw1_prob2.py
<br/>

**Homework 3**\
I created one python file for Lambda = 1, Lambda = 25, and Lambda = 150. The corresponding graphs can be found in the "graphs" subfolder.\

Python files for **Homework 3**
- hw1_prob3_lam1
- hw1_prob3_lam25
- hw1_prob3_lam150
